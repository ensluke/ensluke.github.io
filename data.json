        "It bears an uncanny and unexplained resemblance to a POKé BALL. Because it explodes at the slightest shock, even veteran TRAINERS treat it with caution.",
        "A life-form whose identity is unknown. It is said to SCREECH or suddenly SELFDESTRUCT.",
        "Usually found in power plants. Easily mistaken for a POKé BALL, it has zapped many people.",
        "It looks just like a Poké Ball. It is dangerous because it may electrocute or explode on touch.",
        "It rolls to move. If the ground is uneven, a sudden jolt from hitting a bump can cause it to explode.",
        "It was discovered when Poké Balls were introduced. It is said that there is some connection.",
        "It looks just like a Poké Ball. It is dangerous because it may electrocute or explode on touch.",
